# Week 6 - Layout with Columns
Multiple column layouts can be implemented via CSS using floats.


## Columns
A three column layout would look something like the following:

**html**
```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
     First column
  </div>
  <div class="column">
     Second column
  </div>
  <div class="column">
     Thrid column
  </div>
</div>
```

**css**
```css
.column {
  width: 30%;      /* set column width */
  float: left;     /* float left or right */
  margin: 0 1.5%;  /* set left & right gutter */
}
```

The row class has a clearfix which will clear the floats & bring back it's children elements to normal flow.
Each column is floated left, making them line up horizontally.
They also have a width of 30% & margin left & right of 1.5%.
One column has a total width of 33%.

There are 3 columns, `33% * 3 = 99%` which will fill up the whole row.


## CSS Grid Systems
A grid system is a structure that allows for content to be stacked both vertically and horizontally in a consistent and easily manageable fashion. Additionally, grid system code is project-agnostic giving it a high degree of portability so that it may be adopted on new projects.
