# Week 1 - Intro to the Course

## Homework:
- Set up your class web page. All students are required to have hosting space to post their designs, assignments, and ultimately their final web site. Students are required to purchase a hosting plan with a third party hosting provider. Past students have purchased hosting plans from [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/), [NameCheap](http://www.namecheap.com/), [HostGator](http://www.hostgator.com/), and [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) (these are just a few of many hosting providers available). Plans should include ample disk space (ie. more than 2GB or unlimited), support for CGI, PHP, and MySQL, multiple domain hosting (to host more than one site), one-click install/support for Wordpress, Joomla, and Drupal (popular CMS options), and a low, competitive price (an example rate is around $3-$5/month â€“ this is subject to change based upon current trends for hosting prices).
- Once your class web page is set up, email the url to the instructor.
